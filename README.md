# BinarySearchTree
Implementation using Binary Search Tree. The first project implements the HeapSort algorithm to sort arrays efficiently, while the second project demonstrates the use of a Binary Search Tree (BST) for insertion, search, and removal operations. The programs highlight how these structures and algorithms perform under different conditions and include performance evaluations, showcasing the computational efficiency of both sorting and searching.
